<h1>Freshwater Quality Prediction</h1>
<p> Classifying whether a sample of freshwater is safe to drink or not.</p>
<p> The dataset used in the project has around 5.9M samples distinguished by 21 features. <a href="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/he-public-data/datasetab75fb3.zip">It can be found here</a></p>
Trained 2 models-<strong> Logistic Regression</strong> and <strong>LightBGM classifier</strong><br>Logistic Regression yielded an accuracy of 76% while the LightBGM classifier produced an accuracy of 86% <br>
Used Simple Imputer for imputation of null values and minmax scaler for scaling<br>
The dataset was imbalanced so SMOTE was used to maintain a balanced distribution of class in the dataset <br>
Dimensionality reduction was achieved using PCA.</p>
